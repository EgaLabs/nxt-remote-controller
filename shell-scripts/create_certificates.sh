# localhost.key = 4096 bits long modulus key encrypted with AES 256.
# localhost.pem = Decrypted version of localhost.key.
# localhost.csr = Certificate request filled with your data.
# localhost.cnf = File with some default values to create the localhost.csr.
# localhost.crt = Your certificate.
# localhost-DER.crt = Exported version of the localhost.crt with DER format which is compatible with Android. Normal CA doesn't work in some Android versions.

# Genereates a private key. It will ask you for a password. DON'T REMOVE THAT NEVER.

# Then we will decrypt it to extract the public key. Maybe this is useless for you.

# Then we generate a certificate request. That is what usually you send to the certificate authority (CA) to sign it for you, to prove your identity.

# Then we generate the certificate which you will use in your server.
